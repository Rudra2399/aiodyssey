          Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the idea of enabling machines to perform tasks that normally require
          human intelligence. That includes developing algorithms that can process data, learn from it, and make
          decisions. AI has a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants to self-driving cars, and the field
          continues to evolve.

        <p>Artificial Intelligence encompasses a spectrum of capabilities, ranging from specialized task execution to
          human-like cognitive abilities:</p>
        <ol class="content-list">
          <li>
            <h3>Narrow/Weak AI</h3>
            <p>Narrow AI, often known as Weak AI, is designed to excel in specific tasks within a limited domain. These
              AI systems exhibit exceptional proficiency in their assigned tasks but lack general cognitive abilities.
              Examples include voice assistants like Siri, which can understand and respond to voice commands, or
              virtual chess players that can analyze complex game positions and make optimal moves.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>General/Strong AI</h3>
            <p>General AI, or Strong AI, aims to replicate the comprehensive cognitive abilities of humans. This type of
              AI can understand, learn, and adapt across a broad range of domains, similar to human intelligence. While
              Narrow AI excels in specialized tasks, achieving General AI remains a complex challenge. It requires
              machines to possess not only the ability to perform tasks but also to understand context, think
              abstractly, and even experience emotions.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>These distinct types of AI underscore the evolution of artificial intelligence, from specialized problem
          solvers to potential companions with human-like cognitive prowess.</p>

        <h2>History of AI</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Emerging in the 1950s, AI aimed to replicate human-like intelligence in machines. Early pioneers like Alan
          Turing and John McCarthy laid the groundwork, introducing the concept of machines mimicking human thinking.
          The Dartmouth Workshop in 1956 marked the formal beginning of AI as a field.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The 1960s and 1970s brought enthusiasm for AI research, but challenges in solving complex problems and
          understanding natural language led to the first "AI winter" of reduced funding and optimism. The 1980s and
          1990s shifted focus to knowledge-based and expert systems, yet limitations in handling uncertainty persisted,
          leading to another "AI winter."
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The 2000s witnessed an AI resurgence, driven by machine learning breakthroughs. Neural networks enabled
          learning from data and led to advancements in natural language processing and computer vision. Recent years
          brought the rise of deep learning, revolutionizing image recognition, language translation, and more. AI now
          impacts diverse industries, from healthcare to entertainment.

        <h2>How AI Works</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms,
          allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. AI is a broad field of
          study that includes many theories, methods and technologies, as well as the following major subfields:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Machine learning</b> automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks,
              statistics,
              operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for
              where to look or what to conclude.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>A neural network</b> is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like
              neurons) that
              processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The
              process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Deep learning</b> uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of
              advances
              in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data.
              Common applications include image and speech recognition.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Computer vision</b> relies on pattern recognition and deep learning to recognize what’s in a picture or
              video. When machines can process, analyze and understand images, they can capture images or videos in real
              time and interpret their surroundings.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Natural language processing</b> (NLP) is the ability of computers to analyze, understand and generate
              human language, including speech. The next stage of NLP is natural language interaction, which allows
              humans to communicate with computers using normal, everyday language to perform tasks.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, several technologies enable and support AI:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Graphical processing units</b> are key to AI because they provide the heavy compute power that’s
              required for
              iterative processing. Training neural networks requires big data plus compute power.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The Internet of Things</b> generates massive amounts of data from connected devices, most of it
              unanalyzed. Automating models with AI will allow us to use more of it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Advanced algorithms</b> are being developed and combined in new ways to analyze more data faster and at
              multiple levels. This intelligent processing is key to identifying and predicting rare events,
              understanding complex systems and optimizing unique scenarios.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>APIs, or application programming interfaces</b>, are portable packages of code that make it possible to
              add AI functionality to existing products and software packages. They can add image recognition
              capabilities to home security systems and Q&A capabilities that describe data, create captions and
              headlines, or call out interesting patterns and insights in data.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, the goal of AI is to provide software that can reason on input and explain on output. AI will
          provide human-like interactions with software and offer decision support for specific tasks, but it’s not a
          replacement for humans – and won’t be anytime soon.</p>
